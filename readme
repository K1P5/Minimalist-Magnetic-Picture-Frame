Magnetic Picture Frame

Please see "Getting Started.pdf" for assembly instructions.

A minimalist approach to hanging a print, this magnetic frame post is easy to assemble and install with minimal tools.

NOTE: Each Post Body and Retention Cap features embedded magnets. For mine, I use 0.24 cubic inch neodymium magnets (further specs unknown, p/n lost); Embedded during the print process using GCODE pauses. Other methods of insertion could be implemented, .sldprt files are included for further magnet customization.

Simply mount the Post Anchor (Pt. A) onto any surface using a single #6 drywall screw (anchors optional/based on the exact mounting surface). Repeat this step for all corners of your print (more can be added, depending on your exact hanging needs). Thread a Post Body (Pt. B) onto each Pt. A, then align your print. Use the Retention Tab(s) (Pt. C) to capture your print, suspending it from the wall.

Once mounted your print appears to float between four posts, projecting one inch (1.0"/25.4mm) from a surface.
